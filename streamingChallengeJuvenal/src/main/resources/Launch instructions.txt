Good Morning,

to deploy this solution, that is collect tweets and process the KPI for all the cities in the world, the technologies stack is needed :
1 - Kafka brokers
2 - A kafka producer client
3 - a twitter client (here I choose to use HBC)
4 - a spark streaming consumer
5 - a relational database (here I supposed it is MySQL)
6 - and a Maven for the build and packaging of the application in jar files

For this solution to be deployed :
1 - Install a Kafka Cluster
2 - Install a MySQL database
3 - ask twitter for OAuth parameter
4 - enter the rights parameters in streaming.properties file
5 - deploy the jar of this application using Maven
6 - when you have the Jar, launch the collect part of the solution, by launching a java -command in the class Launcher. That class is the main class of the project
7 - to deploy the consumer of the solution that will also process the KPI, launch the shll file SparkLauncher.sh

and you are done !
