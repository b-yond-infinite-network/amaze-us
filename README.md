# Amaze us

Hello candidate !

We are super excited that you have elected to take on our technical challenge.

First, some helpful hints:
- **You don't need to finish:** it's better to have a few parts that work, rather than have touched on everything but no
 working software to demonstrate. If you feel frustrated about not having finished, you can write down your plan for the 
 next steps.

- **Choose whichever language and framework you think is most appropriate.** We may have challenged you to choose one in
 particular, but you're a free human! Work with what makes most sense to you.

- **Don't be scared to experiment.** Just let us know it's something new for you and we'll be more than generous with our
 assessment.

- **Show off**, we're here for that!

## Let's start
Below are multiple positions for which we are recruiting. Please be sure to select the position that matches your application, 
otherwise we'll get confused and that makes us sad :)

We should have discussed **_when_** we are expecting your submission: by providing a Pull Request on github with your 
firstname-name as the branch name, this will start the process. If you're going to be late, please let us know...

At the end of the process, **_we will_** refuse your PR: please don't take this as a bad sign. It just means we want to 
keep our master branch clean and shiny. If you're proud of it and want to keep your code to yourself, we advise that you 
fork our repo instead of creating a branch, and make a PR out of your fork.

We'll get back to you as soon as your Pull Request has been reviewed (hopefully to tell you how amazing your code is!).

If you have any questions, comments or suggestion, please don't hesitate to get in touch with HR representative or the recruiter.
