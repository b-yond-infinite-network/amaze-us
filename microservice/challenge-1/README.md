# Challenge 1 - Saving the cathedrals

Once upon a time, there was a kingdom of monolithic apps. 

All the buildings where giant and tightly architected to reach as high as possible. 
Each tower touched the sky, one patch at a time. Their bridges and hallways all hanging by the threads and little hacks 
accumulated over the years.

But a threat is looming...

The biggest of the biggest earthquakes is about to strike underneath the kingdom. 

From what the crazy mad scientists tell you, only the apps that have no patch and no hacks will survive.  
Knowing the state of all those apps, only the house and shop will be left if you don't do something quick.

But you're a Knight of ContainerD - you know you can save them all.   
You just have to slice those monoliths up in the right way.


These are the building you can save:

- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples
- https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM

Choose one; choose the orchestrator you want to use; and make it scale!
