Context:

Purpose of the project is to  to refactor a monolithic JAXRS based simple Reminder App in Java into a microservice app deployable locally and on cloud.
The existing application got a set of service that store reminders and support CRUD operations through MySQL based datastore. There is no sophisticated business logic,
apart from CRUD there is only one search criteria which finds reminders between date range.
